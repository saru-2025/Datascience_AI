This project performs data analysis on IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match data using Python. The goal is to explore match outcomes, team performance trends, player contributions, and other insights using visualizations and data wrangling techniques.

## 📁 File Structure

- `IPL_data_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔍 Features

- Import and cleaning of IPL dataset  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on:
  - Match winners and total matches
  - Toss decisions vs match outcomes
  - Top performing teams and players
  - Player of the Match analysis
- Data visualization for trend identification  
- Insights for cricket fans and analysts  

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Open `IPL_data_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Ensure the dataset (CSV files, if external) are in the same directory, or update paths in the notebook.
4. Run all cells step-by-step to see outputs and charts.

## 📊 Example Outputs

- Bar plots for team wins
- Pie charts of toss decision analysis
- Heatmaps of player contributions

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure you have the dataset (e.g., `matches.csv`, `deliveries.csv`) if referenced separately.
- You can extend the analysis to include season-wise breakdowns, player partnerships, or venue-specific stats.
